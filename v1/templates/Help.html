<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-185" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">Here is an overview of how ClassMarker works. Please review other help articles for more detailed help and instructions.<br>
<br>
The Tests section is where you create and edit questions and tests. There are a number of different question types available. Create your test with fixed questions, where the same questions are displayed each time the test is taken, or you can utilize the auto-selection feature where questions are selected at random from your specified categories each time the test is taken.<br>
<br>
With ClassMarker you can create as many questions and tests as you like. <br>
<br>
Once you have created your questions and tests you'll want to provide access to them. ClassMarker refers to this as "Assigning" your test; look out for the Assign buttons across the site.<br>
<br>
It's important to note that each test can be assigned any number of times to different sets of users with different settings applied. There is no need to duplicate a test, instead simply assign it as many times as you like.<br>
<br>
ClassMarker gives you two options for assigning (providing access) to your tests:<br>
<br>
Firstly via Groups. Once you've created a Group you can register users to it. Registered users will log in via the ClassMarker.com website where they can access the tests you have assigned to their group.<br>
<br>
The second option is to create a Link to your test - this link can be sent out to users, or you can add or embed the test into your website using the code we provide. No user registration is required and you can apply user information questions that are displayed before the test starts. You can brand tests with your organization's logo and colours by applying a Theme. Restrict access to tests assigned via link by implementing an Access List, and password protection is also available.<br>
<br>
When you assign a test you will be provided with a number of customizable settings to ensure your test is delivered according to your requirements. These include time &amp; date availability, number of attempts allowed, whether a certificate is to be included, the pass mark, pass and fail feedback messages plus many more settings. You can also save Default Settings to streamline the assign process.<br>
<br>
You can view test results in many ways with ClassMarker, from viewing an individual's progress in real time, to aggregated statistics for tests, questions, categories and more.<br>
<br>
Don't forget to look for Export options - ClassMarker offers the ability to export detailed results reports to Excel where you can sort and filter the data as you require.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-186">My Data</a></p>
<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-186" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">On the Dashboard you will find a snapshot of your account. <br>
<br>
The My Data section to the right of the page displays what data you have under your account. <br>
You can use the My Data quick-links to easily access the different sections of your account.<br>
<br>
View the Recent Results tabs (By Test, By Group or By Link) to see results saved in the last 30 days. (For a full history of your results go to the main navigation and view the Tests, Groups or Links sections.)</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-75">Register for free</a></p>

<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-164" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">The Tests section is where you add and edit questions and tests. Access the Tests section either via the main navigation or via the quick-links displayed at top right of your screen.<br>
<br>
With ClassMarker you can create as many questions and tests as you like.<br>
<br>
Adding questions:<br>
ClassMarker provides 3 ways to add questions to your account.<br>
<ol><li>Add questions to the Question Bank. All tests can select questions from the Question Bank, and each question can be re-used any number of times. </li><li>Create a test, and then add questions directly into the test. These questions are also automatically added to the Question Bank which means they can be used in other tests if required.</li><li>Prepare batches of questions offline and import them to ClassMarker via the Question Bank.</li></ol><br>
<br>
Adding tests:<br>
When you create a test you will find two options for selecting the questions that will be displayed when your test is taken.<br>
<br>
1. Adding Fixed questions means the same set of questions is displayed each time the test is taken.<br>
2. Adding Auto-Selected questions means questions are automatically selected from specified categories within your Question Bank. Each time the test is taken, a different set of questions is displayed.<br>
You can combine these two methods if you wish and your test will display a mix of fixed and auto-selected questions.<br>
<br>
Once you have created your questions and tests you'll want to provide access to them. ClassMarker refers to this as "Assigning" your test; look out for the Assign buttons across the site.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-187">Setting</a></p>
<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-187" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">When you assign (provide access to) a test (either by Group or Link) you will be provided with a number of customizable settings to ensure your test is delivered according to your requirements. These include time &amp; date availability, number of attempts allowed, whether a certificate is to be included, the pass mark, pass and fail feedback messages and many more. Look out for the (?) symbols on the settings page for individual explanations.<br>
<br>
<strong>Default Settings</strong><br>
Once you have selected your settings, you will save them at the bottom of the page. Each time you assign a test you are also given the option to save these settings as default, which means they will be preloaded for you next time you assign a test.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-125">How quickly can I setup an online test?</a></p>

3. Analyze the results<br>
<br>
It's really that easy. If you have a large number of questions you can use the import function. You can define a number of different settings so that the test is configured exactly how you want it, and you can either register your users, let them register themselves, or Assign (distribute) the Test via Link to groups of non-registered users.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-38">Can my Tests select questions randomly from my Question bank?</a></p>

<br>
First you need to retrieve the YouTube/Vimeo URL for the video you would like to embed:<ol class="help"><li>Go to YouTube/Vimeo and find your video.</li><li>The URL in your browser will look something like this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojSngu0Qp8E.

<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-60" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">Please check what file type are you using to edit your question template: <br>
Windows default text editor "Notepad" will not format the question text correctly. You need to use an advanced text editor such as Notepad++ which can be <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v5.9.5.html"> downloaded for free</a>.<br>
<br>
If you're already using an advanced text editor, please ensure that you are not copying and pasting from Microsoft Word as this can sometimes create characters that are not UTF-8 compatible. If your characters are not UTF-8 compatible they will not format correctly.<br>
<br>
This means you may need to source those specific characters from a different source such as a UTF-8 website, for example: http://www.utf8-chartable.de/ where you can copy and paste the required characters into your .txt template.<br>
<br>
Please always first make sure the characters in the .txt files are all 'readable', they will then be able to be uploaded to ClassMarker.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-67">How many questions can I display per page?</a></p>

<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-93" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">You can randomize multiple choice answers for each question via the question settings in your Question bank pages.<br>
<br>
This is a great way to help stop users from sharing answers.<br>
<br>
You can choose your random settings on a per question basis when adding or editing your multiple choice questions.<br>
<br>
Note: The A), B), C) prefix is not shown during the test for questions whose answers are given in random order. This is because final results are always displayed in original answer ordering and creates confusion if a user recalls selecting an answer with prefix A) for a question, however, the results view show their selected answer now with a prefix as C).</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-94">What are my options for multiple response question grading styles?</a></p>
<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-94" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">You can set Multiple response questions to give 'full' points only when all the correct answers and no incorrect answers are selected, or allow for partial points to be awarded for correct answers.<br>
<br>
There are three grading methods.<br>
<br>
Partial scoring options:<br>
<ul class="help"><li>Off - Full points for full correct answer, zero points if an error is made </li><li>Partial points with deduction - Remove partial points for incorrect answers</li><li>Partial points - Do not remove points for incorrect answers </li></ul>Example: Partial scoring with deduction<br>
A question worth 3 points with 3 correct answers will gain 1 point for each correct answer selected but also lose 1 point for each incorrect answer selected.<br>
<br>
Example: Partial scoring<br>
A question worth 3 points with 3 correct answers will gain 1 point for each correct answer selected.<br>
<br>
Partial scoring will not give negative points. Zero is the minimum points awarded.<br>
<br>
Note: ClassMarker will limit the amount of selections allowed to the amount of correct answers given for the question to stop a user selecting all answers.<br>
<br>
You can choose your grading style settings on a per question basis when added or editing your multiple response questions.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-181">Can I place a hyperlink in my questions?</a></p>

<br>
When you assign (distribute) your test you can choose whether you'd like to include a certificate, and you can also define whether the certificate will be displayed to all users upon completion of the test, or if the certificate should only be displayed if the user achieves a pass grade (the pass grade is also defined by you).</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-91">How do I create and edit certificates?</a></p>

Allow users to download a custom certificate once they have completed a test: Within the Test settings choose whether to display a certificate for your test, and choose whether it will show 'Always on completion', or 'Only when the test is passed'.</div><div class="clearheight5"></div></div><p class="sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" id="faqtog_help-main81" class="sub-header">Categories Â»</a></p>

* via Link<br>
<br>
Use the Groups Section to add and edit your Groups. You can also review Group results from this page.<br>

Assigning tests gives you control on exactly who accesses your tests, and when. It also gives you complete control by keeping results separated for your various user groups, if required.<br>
<br>
ClassMarker offers three options for users to access their tests.<br>
<ol class="help"><li>Groups: Under the Users section you can create Registered user groups. Users are assigned a username and password and they access their tests using these login details on the ClassMarker website. Tests must be assigned to one of your Registered user groups for the underlying members to be able to access your tests.</li><li>Links Direct: By assigning your test via a Link you can simply send your users a web link to access your tests. Public and private options are available.</li><li>Links Embedded: Embed tests directly into your website again by assigning via Link / embed code method. Public and private options are available.</li></ol>When you are assigning your tests, this is where you select options such as Time limits, Results access and more.<br>

<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-53" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">To unassign a test from a Group:<ol class="help"><li>Go to your Groups or Links section, find the group/test and click 'Settings'.</li><li>For a Registered user Group select the Unassign test button from the right hand panel. For Links select 'Delete link and any Results it contains' from right hand panel.</li></ol><br>
<br>
Note: You can only unassign tests that have been assigned via Group. Tests that have been assigned via Link must have their Link group deleted.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-57">Should I assign my test via Registered user groups, or via a Direct link?</a></p>
<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-57" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">When you assign your tests via Registered user Groups your users will access the test via our website www.classmarker.com, and they will have an account that has been setup by you, the administrator (under the Users section).<br>
<br>
When you assign your tests via Link / embed code your users will access the test via the Link that you have sent to them, or via your website where you have added the test. Tests assigned via this method do not have a defined set of users, i.e, users are not pre-registered. There are public and private options available so that you can restrict who will take your test.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-144">How do I integrate my own website and user IDs with a ClassMarker test?</a></p>
<div class="dotted"></div><div id="dofaqtog_help-sub-144" class="hide faq-sub-sub gray">ClassMarker optionally allows you to integrate your own user ids with test results allowing you to easily export this data or send data (including test results) back to your own website in real time.<br>
<br>
You can record your own users ids by automatically appending them to the Link your users click to take their test (if they are logged in to your website for example).<br>
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
http://www.classmarker.com/yourtestlink?...&amp;<strong>cm_user_id</strong>=123<br>
<br>
The <strong>cm_user_id</strong> will hold your users "user id for your system" and will save this against their test results.<br>
<br>
You can also require tests can only be taken if a user_id is supplied, and limit each user id to one attempt only per test.<br>
<br>
ClassMarker also lets you set a return link for users to follow back to your website after they have completed their test.<br>
<br>
Return links can also have the users details, test score and duration appended to it for you to record in real time on your own website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
http://yourLINK?<strong>cm_ts</strong>=24&amp;<strong>cm_tp</strong>=72&amp;<strong>cm_td</strong>=0-12-35&amp;<br>
<strong>cm_fn</strong>=John&amp;<strong>cm_ln</strong>=Smith&amp;<strong>cm_e</strong>=john@example.com<br>
<br>
<strong>Where:</strong> <br>
<strong>cm_ts</strong>=Test Score <br>
<strong>cm_tp</strong>=Test Percentage <br>
<strong>cm_td</strong>=Test Duration (0-12-35 = 0h 12m 35s) <br>
<strong>cm_fn</strong>=first name <br>
<strong>cm_ln</strong>=last name <br>
<strong>cm_e</strong>=email address<br>
<br>
<strong>Return custom variables</strong><br>
You can also add your own unique parameters to be returned to you on the return link, by pre pending the parameter names with <strong>cm_return_</strong><br>
<br>
Example: The parameter cm_return_employee_id=1234 will be returned to you as &amp;<strong>cm_return_employee_id</strong>=1234<br>
<br>
When testing non-registered users via Link or embedding tests within your website, as well as password protecting your tests, you also have the option to limit exactly who can access your tests by using 'Access list'.<br>
<br>
An Access list is a list of unique identifiers you add (email address, employee ids, etc.) that a user must use to access your test/s. You can limit how many times each unique identifier can be used per test and they are recorded along with the respective test results.<br>
<br>
Both access list items and cm_user_id values can be exported to Excel format with test results, date taken, test duration and IP address.<br>
<br>
These methods do not require users to be registered to take your tests, and if using access lists you can mass import identifiers when creating and editing lists.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-160">Can I add or embed a test into my website?</a></p>

There are public and private options available so that you can restrict who will take your test (please see the Assign section in FAQ/Help for more information).<br>
<br>
Each test assigned via Links gives you a link for your test that you can send to your users, or you can embed the test within your website. You can allow users to register a username and password so they can come back and complete a test at a later date if required.<br>
<br>
Tests assigned via Links can have themes assigned to them to allow branding for your organization.<br>
<br>
Only one test per web page can be embedded. You can embed unlimited tests across different pages on your website.</div><p class="sub-sub-header-p"><a href="https://www.classmarker.com/a/help/#" class="showcont" id="faqtog_help-sub-116">How are non-registered / direct link user groups defined?</a></p>
